# Total-number-of-tablets
I have made a program that tells us the total number of tablets in real-time and we can add more functions like color differentiation Etc. This code will help companies to find the missing tablets in their high-speed blister machine,  this code will tell them about the total number of tablets present and the desired number of tablets. 

# how-to-setup
You have to use a different camera connect it to your PC and set the cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1) and if you are using your in built camera then set the cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0).

# working
After running the code new window will pop up and then you can see the count of tablets and their shape in real time 

#under development
Color detection
place of missing tablet
*These things are under development and I will keep you guys updated about it
